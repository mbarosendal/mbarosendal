## Hi there 👋

My name is Michael. I'm currently studying data science in Denmark, focusing on building a strong programming foundation in C# and the .NET framework.

- 📚 Specializing in Automation, Scripting (Py, PoSh), Backend Development and API Design
- 💡 Interested in full-stack, automation, and getting systems to communicate efficiently
- 🛠️ Working on smaller pet projects like a wallpaper shuffler, pomodoro timer and task manager
- 🎓 Graduating summer 2026

I'm keeping a portfolio where I post about my learning this semester (august-december, 2025) [here](https://mbarosendal.github.io/Portfolio/).

I'm also doing simple experiments for some of my posts to support my learning, these can be found [here](https://github.com/mbarosendal/?tab=repositories&q=topic%3Aexperiments).
